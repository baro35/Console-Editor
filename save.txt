Shifting to electric vehicles will still leave the UK with s
        erious transport problems, a report has said.

The IPPR think tank said emissions will fall, but the number
         of cars on the road will continue to grow.

It foresaw a 28 increase in car ownership by 2050, leading t
            o more jams and harm to the economy.

But the government said it had plans to make transport green
er and it was committed to offering people a range of travel
                          options.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in March that car use 
                        must shrink.

The IPPR said Mr Shapps long-awaited Transport Decarbonisati
on Strategy should harmonise with this by committing to peak
                   car ownership by 2030.

Unless there is a change in policy, car ownership is expecte
 to be driven up by a growing economy and increasing popula
                            tion.

The IPPR said failure to tackle this will have negative effe
